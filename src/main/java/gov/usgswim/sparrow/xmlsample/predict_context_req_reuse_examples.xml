	This doc contains multiple prediction contexts to show examples more compactly.
	Normally only one is allowed per document (and it would be the document root).

	The examples in this document just show how the four child elements of a
	prediction context can be reused in other prediction contexts just by referencing
	their id number.
	-->

	<!-- Example 1 -->
	<PredictionContext

		A prediction context may be built up from pieces that have previously defined.

		* Those refered to by a 'predefined' id are pulled from the database where they
		are permanently stored.

		* Those refered to by 'context-id' were defined by another request and are
		being stored in a cache on the server.

		<analysis context-id="1093474"/>

		<!--
