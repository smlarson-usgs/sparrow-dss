					I initially selected HUC 01746286 and 01746289,

					As a start, we are proposing a 10% reduction across the board,
					but we will tailor this later based on plant type.

					The Farmer's Alminac says corn planting will be up 20% this year,

					This is an estimate so I'm leaving it out of the runs created	for the EPA.
