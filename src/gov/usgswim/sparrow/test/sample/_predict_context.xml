				<!--
				Required if group-by is specified.  Applies an aggregate function to the
				data-series specified to return a single calculated value for each group.
				An aggregate function (as defined here) is a function that can be calculated
				solely based on the values within the group.  Thus, rankings are not
				supported as an aggregate function b/c they cannot be calculated from the
				values within the group (see analytic-function).
				
				The 'per' attribute does the same aggregate function on a physical
				property and divides the aggregated value by the aggregated 'per' value.
				

				
				- - Possible Values - -
				sum
				avg
				max
				min
				stddev
				
				- - Examples - -
				1.	data-series:  incremental
						group-by:  HUC8
						agg-function:  sum
						agg-function[per]:  area
				
				Within each HUC8, sum the incremental value for each reach and divide by
				the sum the areas.  This would generate an incremental yeild value for the
				entire HUC8.  One row is returned per	HUC8 and the row id is the HUC8 ID.
				
				2.	data-series:  total
						group-by: HUC8
						agg-function: max
				Within each HUC8, find the maximum total value.  One row is returned per
				HUC8 and the row id is the HUC8 ID.  This would be a good approximation
				of the HUC8 total value.

				-->
				<agg-function per="area">avg</agg-function> <!-- rank would be rank of the group within the whole -->
				
				<!--
				The analytic function is applied after grouping and the aggregate function
				takes plus, thus, one 'row' for the analytic function is the already
				aggregated results from the aggregate function.  If there is no	group-by,
				each reach is considered its own group.  
				
				The analytic function can compare the rows (ranking) within the entire
				returned set, or it can make the comparison based on subsets of the
				entire result, such as a HUC - this is done using the partitioning
				attribute.
				
				The max-source function is categorical and compares the individual values
				calculated up to this point and creates a column containing the id of
				the maximum source (remember, data series and aggregate functions
				are applied to all sources, so all source values are available and have
				had the same caluculation applied to them).  Partitioning cannot be
				applied to max-source.
				
				The source-share function calculates the fraction of each calculated
				source value to the total value.  The data column is the source identified
				in the data-series 'source' attribute, which must be present (err if not).
				
				
				- - Values - -
				rank-desc
				rank-asc
				dense-rank-desc
				dense-rank-asc
				max-source	(id of the max source value for the series)
				source-share (share of the source compared to the total value)
				...and other statistical functions which return a result for one value
				within a group.
				
				
	
				Examples:
				1.
				data-series: incremental (defined above)
				group-by: HUC8 (return one row per HUC8)
				agg-function: avg
				analytic-function: rank-desc
				window: HUC6 (calculate w/in the context of each HUC6)
				
				The incremental value is calculated for each reach and is averaged at
				the HUC8 level.  That average value is then ranked within each HUC6, with
				the highest value give the rank '1'.
				Thus, within each HUC6, HUC8's will be given values 1-n.
				
				2.
				data-series: incremental (defined above)
				group-by: -not defined- (return one row per reach)
				agg-function: -not defined-
				analytic-function: rank-desc
				window: HUC6 (calculate w/in the context of each HUC6)
				
				The incremental value is calculated for each reach.  That value is then
				ranked within each HUC6, with the highest value give the rank '1'.
				Thus, within each HUC6, each reach will be given values 1-n.
				
				3.
				data-series: incremental (defined above)
				group-by: HUC8 (return one row per HUC8)
				agg-function: sum
				analytic-function: max
				partition: HUC6 (calculate w/in the context of each HUC6)
				
				The incremental value is calculated for each reach and is averaged at
				the HUC8 level.  That average value is then ranked within each HUC6, with
				the highest value give the rank '1'.
				Thus, within each HUC6, HUC8's will be given values 1-n.
